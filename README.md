# Welcome to Java
types of data are devided into two categores

- primitive data types
- non-primitive data types

primitive data types include
- different types of numbers
  - byte -> Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
  - short -> Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
  - int -> Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 -- this is the most common one
  - long -> Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  - float -> Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
  - double -> Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
- boolean -> true or false
- char -> Stores a single character/letter or ASCII value

non primitive data types include but are not limited to
- Strings (like groups of characters strung together)
- Arrays (like groupings of data of other types)
- Classes (like templates for objects that we create)

objects are instances of one of the data types

we can create our own types of objects by defining classes

if your class or other data type was like the blueprints to build a house then your object would be an individual constructed house
