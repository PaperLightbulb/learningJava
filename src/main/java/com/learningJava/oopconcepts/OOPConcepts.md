# OOP Concepts
- Abstraction
  - hide irrelevant details
  - show the user (and other programmers) only what they need to see
- Encapsulation
  - keep data and methods related to that data together and segregated from the rest of your code
  - make it so code isnt overly dependent on other bits of code
- Inheritance
  - classes can inherit from other classes and use them as a base to build upon
- Interfaces
  - interfaces are the public methods of a class
  - they are what the rest of the program interacts with
- Polymorphism
  - you can have multiple methods of the same name with different arguments to accomidate a range onf scenarios
- Association
  - how closely one class is associate with another is how interconnected they are
  - generally, we want to limit over association
- Aggregation
  - HAS-A relationship
  - one class has an instacne of another class inside it
- Decoupling
  - the process of speperating the inner workings of classes and only letting them interact through public method headers
- Packages
  - groupings of classes that can interact more closely
